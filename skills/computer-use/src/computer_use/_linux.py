"""Linux X11 backend: xwininfo observation, xdotool input, maim capture.

This module is the Linux half of the computer-use backend seams. It mirrors the
mac modules the App layer consumes (ax observation, inject input, capture,
apps discovery) keyed by X11 window id instead of pid, and every top-level
name is underscore-private: the module is internal, only the App layer's
dispatch (through _compat.require_linux) reaches it.

Observation runs `xwininfo -root -tree -int` and parses the whole root tree
with one parser shared with app discovery. X11 window tree observation is the
fallback for at-spi: the design reserves the at-spi source to slot in later
with richer element roles and values; every element here renders as role
"window" with the WM_CLASS as the subrole. The observed window must appear in
the root tree (the tree lists children only, and the root window itself is
never a listed child), so the bound window's own geometry - the root-relative
absolute position - comes from its own line in the root tree; window_rect is
that absolute (x, y, width, height) and element positions are absolute
root-window coordinates, matching the mac App layer's screen-space contract.

Input goes through xdotool, window-bound without activation where supported:
`xdotool key --window <id> <chords>` and `xdotool type --window <id> --delay
<ms> <text>` deliver synthetic (XSendEvent) keyboard input to the bound
window, and `xdotool mousemove --window <id> <x> <y>` moves the pointer with
WINDOW-RELATIVE coordinates (input seams take window-relative points, unlike
the mac inject's screen-space points) followed by a plain XTest click at the
moved pointer. Apps that ignore synthetic events make the plain forms (which
deliver to the focused window or the real pointer) the documented fallback;
this module never retries with them because a plain retry can deliver input to
whatever app currently holds focus, which breaks app scoping.

Capture prefers `maim -i <window_id>` and falls back to `scrot -u -o <path>`
(capture of the FOCUSED window, not the bound one - documented divergence
when maim fails or is absent); the file management, retention sweep, and PNG
dimension verification are reused from computer_use.capture.

X11 window metadata exposes no secure-input role (no AXSecureTextField
equivalent), so type_text on Linux cannot refuse password fields; the gap is
documented in _focused_is_secure.

Errors follow the shared ComputerUseError taxonomy, model-facing:
TRANSPORT_ERROR says the backend is broken (missing tools, a missing DISPLAY,
an unrunnable or hung tool run, and every capture failure) and INVALID_ARGUMENT
covers bad ids, points, buttons, and chords; a completed INPUT run that exits
nonzero raises INJECTION_FAILED instead - the action failed to deliver, so
the model should retry it. APP_NOT_RUNNING covers a bound window missing from
the tree.

Platform gaps this backend documents (each also noted at its seam): X11
window metadata has no secure-input role (no AXSecureTextField equivalent),
there is no session-lock probe (the mac policy check fails open as False on
linux), no TCC grants apply, there is no app-launch story (binding resolves
running windows only), and there is no clipboard or per-element value API
(paste, set_value, select_text, and secondary actions have no X11 backing).
