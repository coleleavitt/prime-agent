//! The shared, project-neutral multi-account credential store.
//!
//! Canonical location is `~/.anthropic-accounts/accounts.json` so that every
//! consumer — a coding agent, a build tool, a one-off request client — reads the
//! same credentials instead of each keeping a private copy under its own config
//! directory.
//!
//! Resolution order for the store path:
//!   1. an explicit path passed by the caller,
//!   2. `$ANTHROPIC_ACCOUNTS_FILE` (full path),
//!   3. `$ANTHROPIC_ACCOUNTS_DIR/accounts.json`,
//!   4. `$HOME/.anthropic-accounts/accounts.json`.
//!
//! [`AccountStore::load_or_migrate`] additionally folds in any known legacy
//! per-application store that has not been adopted yet — including the flat
//! pre-shared-store schema — so existing logins are merged rather than lost
//! behind whichever file happened to be found first.
