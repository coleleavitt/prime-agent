//! The session-feature seam: optional, separately built capabilities plug

//! start; [`crate::session_engine::engine::create_session`] asks each
//! installed feature to register its kernel host-request handlers for the
//! session it is building. With nothing installed (the native product, and
//! every native test) the seam is a no-op.
