//! Factory capability eval harness: reference machines, prompt pairing,
//! ledger replay, verdicts, and reporting.
//!
//! Port of the TS-era factory capability eval (`packages/coding-agent/
//! scripts/factory-eval.ts`, PR #2402): the deterministic half of a
//! real-token harness that runs the factory capability layer against live
//! sessions. The driver lives in `crates/pa-daemon/src/bin/factory-eval.rs`
//! (it spawns a dedicated supervisor, seeds this module's factory specs into
//! the harness store, runs factory-vs-baseline trial pairs, and writes the
//! reports this module renders); the unit battery in
//! [`crate::factory_eval::tests`] covers every deterministic piece (spec
//! shapes, prompt invariants, the ANSWER parser, the task-success
//! checkers, the replay checker, the verdicts, the report renderer, and
//! the CLI parsing) so no test needs a live model.
//!
//! The evaluation itself follows the Notion spec's "Proposed evaluation":
//! each reference factory runs against a hand-written manual-orchestration
//! baseline (identical topology, inputs, model, and declared budget) and
//! the report scores the pre-registered verdicts — no task-specific
//! orchestration code in the factory prompts (computed from the built
//! prompts, not assumed), the declared failure policy matching observed
//! behavior (an escalation probe), no node starting after a failed dry run
//! (a broken-spec probe), and zero total budget overshoot over the factory
//! arms. Parent-context comparison against the baseline is reported per
//! pair, informational only. Unknown/unmeasured verdicts are their own
//! class (`Inconclusive`), never a silent pass — the swarm-eval reporting
//! precedent (#3185) this port follows.
