//! Directory-entry durability for wholesale session-file replaces: the
//! rename that lands a rewritten session file must itself be durable, or
//! a hard crash can drop the whole file even though its bytes were
//! synced before the rename. The strict terminal-notice append (the
//! in-process RLM child host's durability strengthening) fsyncs the
//! containing directory after every create/replace rename; the TS
//! product instead tolerates this class through repair-on-open.
