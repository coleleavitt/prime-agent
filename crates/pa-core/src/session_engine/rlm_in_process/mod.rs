//! In-process RLM child sessions: the standalone [`RlmSubagentHost`]
//! implementation a resident embedding (the cloud guest) installs into a
//! session engine. The daemon's supervisor-backed host gives every child
//! its own supervised worker process through the supervisor link; this
//! host runs each child as a full pa-core [`SessionEngine`] inside the
//! parent's own process — no supervisor, no worker processes, no nested
//! daemons — which is the TS guest daemon's hosting model
//! (`createRlmSubagentRuntime` + the session-host core, ported to the
//! Rust engine).
//!
//! Kernel-visible parity with the daemon host: the same
//! [`RlmSpawnHandle`] shape, the same roster/collect/delete envelopes and
//! selector errors, spawn-name reservation across admission, deleted-child
//! tombstones, terminal notices, child usage attribution, and the
//! local-family surface (`agent_message`/`agent_observe` over the
//! in-process parent/siblings/children). Divergences are documented on
//! each seam.
//!
//! Terminal-notice contract: a first-wins claim fixes both verdict and notice
//! obligation. The parent `AgentSession` inbox durably admits the one JSONL row
//! and registers live delivery before publication. Its coalesced queue pump
//! drives a notice-only turn if the running turn missed its last steering
//! poll. On reopen, unconsumed synced rows replay from the original file row;
//! delivery to the model is at least once, not exactly once.
//!
//! Remote family boundary: a resident embedding that adopts this host as
//! its ROOT must supply the [`RlmRemoteFamily`] seam at composition time
//! — the guest root's cloud parent/siblings live beyond the sandbox, and
//! without the seam their messaging (replies included) has no route. The
//! standalone host is local-only and makes no remote-family parity claim;
//! adopting it as a guest root without the seam blocks adoption.
//!
//! Composition contract: the embedding owns the parent engine's lifetime.
//! Drop the parent engine and the whole subtree follows on its own — each
//! child's detached run task races its task prompt and settle wait
//! against the parent binding (a weak edge), notices the teardown within
//! one settle slice even mid-stream, aborts its own run, closes its
//! descendant subtree, settles, and releases its event listener, so the
//! engines and kernels tear down with the tasks' exits (every strong
//! edge points down the tree: parent engine → host → child records →
//! child engines → child hosts; every edge back up is weak). A session
//! CLOSE or replacement — where the parent engine stays alive — must
//! call [`InProcessRlmHost::close_children`] explicitly, the same
//! teardown the run tasks perform on an engine drop.
