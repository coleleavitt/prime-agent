//! System 1 / System 2 harness router (#2484).
//!
//! The session model (System 2) declares an environment with a finite action
//! space and an action-only System 1 sub-model; the router runs the step loop
//! (observe -> decide -> gate -> execute -> record) and hands back the
//! complete trace for steering. One model call per step, the finite action
//! space compiled into a single typed choice, every decision gated by
//! confidence, no free-form generated actions.
//!
//! Rust port of `packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-router/` (the
//! TypeScript-era PR #2484). The module is pure and host-agnostic: it makes no
//! assumptions about where the model, auth, or environment come from. The
//! kernel host-request bridge lives in
//! [`crate::session_engine::system_router_host`].
