//! The installer-takeover update funnel: `prime-agent update` and the TUI's
//! `/update` download the update channel's installer and run it — the
//! official domain endpoint for stable, the download base's
//! `install-beta.sh` for nightly; never a GitHub raw or workflow URL. The
//! script is the single source of truth for the whole move — it resolves
//! and downloads the latest build, uninstalls the TypeScript version,
//! publishes the payload, and never touches `~/.prime/agent` (the sessions
//! and configuration the products share). The command's contract is "fetch
