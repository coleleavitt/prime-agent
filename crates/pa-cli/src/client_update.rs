//! The composition root's `/update` runner: the installer funnel with the
//! output captured — the TUI stays mounted while the install runs, so the
//! installer's own progress never writes to the live frame, and the
//! failure tail becomes the error row's message. It follows the same
//! update channel as `prime-agent update`. The same body
//! `prime-agent update` runs (pa-core's installer module), so the TUI and
//! the CLI cannot diverge.
//!
//! THE WINDOWS EXCEPTION: on Windows the TUI process can be the install's
//! payload binary itself, so the funnel hands off instead of capturing
//! (Windows holds a running payload directory un-renameable — the install
//! can only publish once this process exits). The terminal is handed back
//! whole first (the same best-effort restore every TUI exit runs), the
//! handoff line prints on the restored screen, and the process exits: the
//! note this run would send never lands (the app is gone with it).
