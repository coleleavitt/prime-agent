//! Cloud cross-boundary family messaging substrate.
//!
//! First slice of the cloud family design (`cloud-cross-boundary-messaging-design.md`,
//! D1/D4): the durable wire types live in `pa_types::daemon::cloud` (TS
//! protocol v3 family surface, byte parity); this module adds the journaled
//! request/response exchange and the two seams the cloud registry
//! attachment will wire:
//!
//! - [`exchange::CloudFamilyRequester`] — the guest side. A request is
//!   durably admitted (fsync) before it is awaited; the only delivery truth
//!   is a journaled answer. Offline laptop: the request rides the durable
//!   log and the send surfaces `Pending`, never a receipt.
//! - [`exchange::CloudFamilyResponder`] — the local side. The request is
//!   durably admitted (fsync) BEFORE delivery through
//!   [`exchange::CloudFamilyDelivery`] (the seam that will own the
//!   family-reach assert and the durable local inbox), the answer recorded
//!   durably before it is submitted through
//!   [`exchange::FamilyResultSubmitter`]. A replay with a journaled answer
//!   re-submits it; a replay of an admitted-but-unanswered request (crash
//!   gap, in-flight duplicate) is UNCERTAIN and never re-delivered — the
//!   wiring layer reconciles it and records the answer.
//!
//! Local->guest `send_message` (the [`pa_types::daemon::cloud::CloudSendMessageRequest`]
//! wire form) is submit-journaled by the registry attachment and requires the
//! tunnel attached; it cannot be initiated while the laptop is offline.
//! Nothing in this module fabricates delivery: no fake transport, no local
//! fallback for cloud targets, and no receipt before receiver admission.
//!
//! The production receiver-side seam ([`delivery::LocalFamilyDelivery`])
//! implements [`exchange::CloudFamilyDelivery`] over the real supervisor:
//! the registry, the roster (the family-reach assert over the durable
//! parent edges, [`family::agent_family_relationship`]), and the worker
//! route — with the request-id keyed durable receiver admission (the
//! worker inbox's `cloud_inbox_admission` and the seam's
//! [`inbox::CloudInboxLog`]) that reconciles a crash before or after the
//! delivery without ever duplicating a visible message.
//! [`delivery::reconcile_uncertain`] is the wiring pass that closes the
//! responder's uncertain set through that seam. The cloud registry
//! attachment (tunnel, roster rows, spawn records) wires these against
//! the live cloud rows; nothing here fabricates a transport.
//!
//! Local family messaging (`agent_messaging.rs`, supervisor `send_message`)
//! is untouched; the existing e2e harnesses stay the regression gate.
