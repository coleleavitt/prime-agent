//! The journaled request/response exchange over the family wire slice.
//!
//! Two roles, both driven by durable state (TS `cloud-daemon.ts` guest-side
//! pending requests + `cloud-session-registry.ts` remote-request arms):
//!
//! - [`CloudFamilyRequester`] (guest side, `requester.rs`): one request is
//!   appended to the durable request log BEFORE anything is awaited — the
//!   append is the admission gate, and a stalled log fails the send
//!   honestly. The answer arrives only as a journaled `family_roster_result`
//!   / `agent_message_result` command; until then the send is `Pending`,
//!   never "queued" or "delivered". While the laptop is offline the request
//!   sits durably in the log and no receiver truth exists; on reconnect the
//!   answer rides the journal back.
//! - [`CloudFamilyResponder`] (local side, `responder.rs`): one request event
//!   is durably ADMITTED before any delivery, delivered through the
//!   [`CloudFamilyDelivery`] seam (which owns the family-reach assert and
//!   the durable local inbox admission), and answered through the
//!   [`FamilyResultSubmitter`] seam with the answer durably recorded before
//!   it is submitted. A request admitted without an answer is UNCERTAIN —
//!   a crash may or may not have delivered it — and is never re-delivered
//!   by this substrate; the wiring layer reconciles it and records the
//!   answer, after which a replay re-submits it.
//!
//! Neither role fabricates a delivery path: the delivery and submit seams
//! are wired by the cloud registry attachment; nothing here falls back to
//! local delivery for a cloud target, and a receipt exists only after the
//! receiver admitted the message.
