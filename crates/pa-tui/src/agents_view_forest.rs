//! The agents-view subagent forest: how unified records nest into the session list's rows. One
//! pass computes the record hierarchy (parent linkage, rollups), then row building emits
//! top-level agents with their subagent summary line (the operator's 2026-09-28 one-line merge)
//! and, when expanded, its nested children. Pure functions on the wire forms.
