//!
//! Every route that ends the TUI surface funnels through this module: the
//! deliberate teardown tails (`Renderer::finish`'s parity exit in
//! `interactive.rs`/`agents_view.rs`), the config selector and the replay
//! surface exits, the force-quit watchdog, the fatal error return, a
//! panic unwind, and the composition root's Windows update handoff (the
//! one route that ends the process outside the TUI's own surfaces — the
//! update must replace this binary, so [`restore_terminal`] runs before
//! the process exits). The contract is the whole-terminal invariant set, in
//! one place:
//!
//! 1. the kitty probe stands down first ([`crate::enhanced_keys::release_for_exit`])
//!    — an answer landing after the pop would re-arm CSI-u reporting on
//!    the parent shell (the "escape codes while typing" leak);
//! 2. in-flight key releases drain before the modes come off (TS
//!    `drainInput` before `stop`);
//! 3. mouse tracking, bracketed paste, and the keyboard modes release;
//! 4. synchronized output and SGR reset — a crash between a frame's
//!    sync brackets or inside a styled write must not hand the shell a
//!    terminal holding pending updates or a dangling color;
//! 5. the alternate screen is left (`?1049l`), the window title the first surface saved
//!    comes back ([`crate::terminal_title::restore`]), the cursor shows;
//! 6. the kitty stack drains its stale levels AFTER the alt-screen
//!    leave ([`crate::enhanced_keys::pop_stale_levels`]) — a
//!    mode-counting relay (herdr's pane emulator) discards the
//!    keyboard-protocol writes made while the pane's alt screen is up,
//!    so the pair's pop needs a post-leave drain to land on the relay
//!    (the bare pops are clamped no-ops at spec depth zero);
//! 7. raw mode ends, and the tty is *verified* cooked — crossterm's
//!    `disable_raw_mode` restores its first-saved "original" and
//!    swallows errors, so a poisoned start (a killed previous run left
//!    the tty raw and crossterm adopted that state as the baseline)
//!    would silently restore raw ([`pa_types::platform::terminal`]'s
//!    `stty sane` reconstruction repairs it);
//! 8. a pending Ctrl+S output stop lifts FIRST — the stop is runtime
//!    state, not termios, and it HOLDS writes: the lift (the IXON-toggle,
//!    [`pa_types::platform::terminal::restart_output`]) must precede the
//!    restore's own output writes or the restore itself would hang on a
//!    stopped tty, and the shell would keep the frozen prompt the
//!    restore owed it.
//!
//! The parity exit keeps the TS byte order and ends through
//! [`terminal_release_tail`]; the best-effort exits run the whole sequence
//! without the flush. Divergences from TS (sync-output release, SGR reset,
//! cooked-tty verification) are hardening, documented per sequence.
