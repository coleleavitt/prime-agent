//! Terminal enhanced-key input modes (TS `ProcessTerminal` start/stop).
//!
//! The TS terminal enables bracketed paste (`?2004`) at every start so a
//! multi-line paste arrives as one bracketed chunk instead of per-line
//! keystrokes (each `Enter` inside the chunk would otherwise submit its
//! line), queries the kitty keyboard protocol and enables it
//! (`\x1b[>7u`: disambiguate escape codes, report event types, report
//! alternate keys) when the terminal answers, and falls back to xterm
//! modifyOtherKeys mode 2 (`\x1b[>4;2m`) when no kitty answer arrives in
//! the fallback window. Teardown pops the kitty flags, resets
//! modifyOtherKeys, and disables bracketed paste in the same byte
//! order; the exit tail (`exit_restore`) then drains the stack's stale
//! levels — bare pops after the alt-screen leave, clamped no-ops at
//! spec depth zero (see `STALE_LEVEL_DRAIN`).
//!
//! The kitty query runs on a probe thread that holds no UI state: it
//! blocks inside crossterm's terminal support check until the terminal
//! answers (or its patched 250ms budget lapses) while the fallback timer
//! fires on the TS schedule. The check holds its window in 10ms poll
//! slices (the vendored crossterm patch), so the app reader interleaves
//! and early typing delivers at its own cadence while the probe listens.
//! The reply's verdict reaches the check through the vendored reply watch,
//! whichever reader parsed it: the app reader's own polls parse the reply
//! too, and under CPU contention the check used to lose every round of the
//! shared reader lock to them, so an in-time reply sat parked while the
//! window lapsed (the loaded-host "no kitty" misclassification).
//! Crossterm parks user keys in its internal event queue, so early
//! typing is preserved; the app reader never sees protocol bytes as key
//! input. An answer after the 150ms fallback but within the 250ms query
//! window still upgrades to kitty. A reply arriving after that window still
//! concludes the query (the kitty detection contract has no deadline — a
//! slow hop or a loaded host answers late, not never): the vendored reply
//! watch stays armed, and the input reader takes the late verdict and
//! pushes the flags at the answer ([`apply_late_capability_reply`]).
//!
//! The query runs ONCE per process (the first terminal surface), never
//! again on a later start or resume: the terminal's kitty capability
//! cannot change across a stop/continue of the same process, so the
//! probe resolves once and every later start re-applies the resolved
//! state — the observable TS contract (kitty terminals keep CSI-u
//! parsing after a resume; non-kitty terminals never gain it) — and the
//! check's implicit raw-mode bracket can race the app's own suspend
//! bracket, so a re-query at every start carries bracket risk for no
//! capability gain. The first-mount window is the one accepted cost: on
//! silent terminals the probe parks the process-global event-reader
//! lock for its window, but in 10ms slices (the vendored crossterm
//! patch), so input typed during it delivers within a slice instead of
//! waiting for the settle.
//!
//! THE VERDICT TIME (characterized 2026-09-29; the timed contract is
//! locked by `kitty_verdict_time_e2e`): the probe concludes at the
//! FIRST reply, and only the reply classes pay differently. A kitty
//! terminal concludes at its flags reply. A DA1-answering non-kitty
//! terminal — the common non-kitty class; tmux and screen answer DA1
//! locally in microseconds and never answer the flags query —
//! concludes AT THE DA1 ARRIVAL (the reply watch takes a DA1 that
//! arrives first as the "unsupported" verdict; a flags reply arriving
//! after the DA1 can never upgrade). Only a fully-silent pty (no DA1
//! ever — CI harnesses) waits the 250ms deadline, and a reply after it
//! still upgrades (see above). The deadline stays 250ms because it was
//! also the LATE-KITTY catch window:
//! a kitty terminal over a slow hop answers its flags at RTT (this
//! fleet's own single public hop measures 24-29ms; the intercontinental
//! SSH classes ride 80-250ms), so a shorter window would silently drop
//! the enhancement for exactly the remote-SSH deployment this product
//! primarily serves, while buying nothing a user rides (the silent
//! class's only window cost is a mode transition raced inside the first
//! 250ms — measured: the raced suspend's teardown waits to ~250ms on a
//! silent pty and lands at its dispatch on every answered class).
//!
//! DIVERGENCE FROM TS (the shift-modified printable bug class): this port
//! never arms modifyOtherKeys mode 2 and instead resets it
//! (`\x1b[>4;0m`) at every surface start. TS parses the resulting
//! `CSI 27;<mods>;<key>~` sequences itself (keys.ts
//! `parseModifyOtherKeysSequence`), but crossterm 0.28 had no case for
//! them and dropped the whole pending input buffer on the parse error
//! (`Parser::advance` clears on `Err`; the vendored parser now reads the
//! form as its CSI-u key, see `vendor/crossterm/PRIME_AGENT_PATCH.md`) — a terminal in mode 2 (a sticky
//! mode any other pane or process may have armed) made shift-modified
//! printables like `shift+=` vanish entirely. The reset returns such
//! terminals to legacy encodings (shift+= arrives as the produced `+`),
//! and the kitty path covers the enhanced-reporting surface crossterm
//! can parse (kitty CSI-u with shifted alternates resolves to the
//! produced character in crossterm's own parser).
//!
//! Every mode-flag transition is serialized (a module-wide lock pairs each
//! flag write with its escape write), and the force-quit exit path marks
//! the terminal released first: a probe answer that lands around the
//! process exit can never push the kitty flags back on after the exit
//! restore popped them.
