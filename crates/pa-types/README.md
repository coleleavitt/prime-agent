# pa-types

The single shared vocabulary crate. Nothing else is shared between crates.

## Scope
Wire and domain types + serde only: AI messages/content blocks/tool calls/usage/stream events, session JSONL entry schema, daemon wire protocol messages, worker frames.

Daemon wire mechanics shared by the serving side (pa-daemon) and clients (pa-tui/pa-cli) live here because pa-tui depends on pa-types alone:
- `daemon::framing`: the private-frame codec of the worker socket (direct-attach clients speak it too).
- `daemon::plane`: the session/control command-plane table (worker-side peer gating and client-side socket routing both read it).
- `daemon::{DaemonPeerTransportTicket, DaemonWorkerPeerGrant, DaemonPeerCommand}`: the direct-transport ticket and grant wire shapes.
- `goal`: the thread-goal wire state (`GoalState`/`GoalStatus`) shared by the
  goal engine (pa-core), the daemon wire (`goal_update` session events and
  the attach snapshot's `state.goal`), and the TUI (announcement rows, tray
  label). The goal *engine* (validation, accounting, continuation prompts)
  is pa-core's.
- `slash_commands`: the builtin slash-command table every surface shares
  (the TUI dispatch + autocomplete, the session engine's command admission,
  CLI suggestion help) plus its pure parse/suggestion helpers — the TS
  product keeps the same single table in core and imports it from its TUI.
- `incident`: the daemon incident classifier shared by the incident CLI
  (pa-cli's `prime-agent incident`, TS `src/cli/incident.ts`) and the
  agents-view incident notice (pa-tui's `incident_notices`, TS
  `src/modes/agents-view/incident-notices.ts`) — pa-tui depends on
  pa-types alone, and the TS product keeps the same single classifier in
  `cli/incident.ts` with both halves importing it. Pure log-line parsing
  (`agent.jsonl` records, per-daemon plain-text lines), worker pid
  attribution, event classification, and the stall/burst/gap anomaly
  computation — the message shapes are the TS regexes kept 1:1. The CLI's
  log-file discovery, `--since`/`--until` window parsing, and report
  rendering belong to pa-cli; the notice polling, rotation-safe
  incremental reads, and dismissal horizons belong to pa-tui.
- `themes`: the bundled theme definition files (`prime`/`dark`/`light`) as
  pure data, shared by the TUI's theme loader (pa-tui renders terminal
  colors from them) and the session HTML exporter (pa-core resolves them
  into CSS variables). Everything built on top of the files — terminal
  color rendering, export CSS generation, custom-theme discovery — belongs
  to the consuming crates.

- `daemon::cloud`: the cloud session wire vocabulary (TS `protocol.ts`,
  protocol v3, `origin/feat/direct-cloud-sandbox @ 193d42bf`): the frame
  union (`hello`/`snapshot`/`subscribe`/`events`/`submit`/`get_command`/
  `command`/`ack`/`inference_*`), the 16-kind command-request union, the
  12-kind event union, receipts, cursors, roster rows, session state,
  model metadata, digests, the canonical-JSON codec
  (JavaScript `String(number)` rendering, JS `.length` UTF-16 bounds), and
  the TS-exact runtime validators. The family slice (family wire types,
  family validators) is PR #3145's; the base slice embeds the family kinds
  and delegates their validation to the family validators, so the family
  surface stays owned in one place. Nothing here transports, journals,
  gates capability advertising, or spawns sessions: the gateway,
  executor, tunnel, and guest wiring belong to pa-daemon/pa-core.
  TS-recorded golden corpus: `tests/golden/cloud_protocol/`
  (regenerate with `tests/golden/cloud_protocol/harness.mjs`).

- `daemon::update_flow`: the update-flow state machine's shared vocabulary:
  the coordinator FSM states + legal
  transition table, `UpdateId`, the on-disk artifact schemas (`intent.json`,
  `status.json` — TS status-file shape, `prepared/<id>/{roster,marker}.json`),
  the roster-snapshot projection (sessions/workers/subagents/heartbeats,
  durable session ids, heartbeat re-arm fields only), the timeout-budget
  table with `PRIME_AGENT_UPDATE_*_MS` overrides, and the artifact path
  layout under `<agent-dir>/update-restarts/`. Pure serde + pure data
  helpers; the FSM drivers and watchdogs are owned by pa-daemon/pa-cli. The
  prepare/commit wire commands (`prepare_update_restart`/`
  commit_update_restart`) and the TS mutation classification
  (`is_daemon_mutating_command`, `is_update_drain_command` — the
  update-flow admission gate's read tables) live in `daemon::{command,plane}`.
Platform contracts (`platform`): the cross-crate transport, process-identity, socket-identity, and home-dir helpers, plus the suspend-to-background signal control (`process::{stop_own_process_group, ignore_sigint_for_suspend, restore_default_sigint}`: the TUI's TS-`handleCtrlZ` cycle — SIGTSTP to the own process group, SIGINT ignored for the stopped window and restored on the SIGCONT resume; unsafe lives behind this wall because pa-tui opts into the workspace `unsafe_code` forbid) (`platform::dirs::home_dir`: `HOME`, then on Windows `USERPROFILE` / `HOMEDRIVE`+`HOMEPATH` - Node `os.homedir()` parity, returning `None` so each caller owns its fallback). pa-types is the only crate every transport consumer can depend on (pa-tui depends on pa-types alone), so the shared trait vocabulary and its cfg-gated platform implementations live here: AF_UNIX on Unix, named pipes (`\.\pipe\`, `platform/windows_pipe.rs`) on Windows. Remaining platform areas (process control, perms, ...) are implemented per platform behind the same traits, not re-plumbed in callers.

Lock conventions (`sync`): `MutexExt::lock_or_recover` and `RwLockExt::{read_or_recover, write_or_recover}`, the poison-tolerant acquisition every crate that depends on pa-types uses for std locks in product code (a panicking holder must not turn every later acquisition in a long-lived process into a panic). The leaf crates without a pa-types dependency (pa-agent, pa-telemetry, pa-mermaid) spell the same thing as `.unwrap_or_else(PoisonError::into_inner)`. `codegraph-rules/locks.yaml` (`pa-lock-unwrap-outside-tests`) flags new unwrapped acquisitions.

## Non-goals
No provider logic, no session logic, no UI. Beyond pure data helpers and the platform contracts, no behavior: a domain type that wants a method belongs in the owning crate.

## Public API
Everything in this crate is deliberately `pub` - it is the cross-crate contract. Unknown fields survive round-trips via catch-all maps so schema revisions stay compatible.

## Depends on
serde, serde_json, thiserror, anyhow, tokio, regex (the incident classifier's TS log-message patterns; see the `incident` scope entry). No workspace crates.
